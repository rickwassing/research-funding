One roadblock in developing more effective treatments is our limited understanding of the pathophysiology. We will combine both animal and human studies and use a wide range of tools to look at the brain, nerves, behaviour, sleep, and more. The goal is to find patterns and changes that are the same in both animals and people, which can help guide the development of new treatments."

Targeting these nerve endings with drugs is a key advance in conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a leading cause of chronic pain. This project will identify how a stable peptide that acts on oxytocin receptors within the gut numbs pain-sensing nerve fibres, providing pain relief for those with IBS."

A cell will undergo only one of these possible responses, but it is not known why some cells die and others only stop growing. We will use innovative methods to define the genes that dictate the cellular response to TP53 activation. This research has implications for cancer, as many therapeutics aim to permanently kill cancer cells by activating TP53."
2001203,Dr Phillip Melton,Ideas Grants,Epigenetic Biomarker Discovery for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Stratification of Women Following Preeclampsia,University of Tasmania,15/12/2020,1275101,Those women whom have suffered from severe complications during pregnancy have an increased risk of developing heart disease. This increased risk may be due to epigenetic changes during pregnancy that alter the expression of specific genes. These epigenetic changes persist after birth and increase heart disease risk for these women. This project seeks to evaluate those epigenetic changes associated with severe pregnancy complications predicting heart disease in a large group of Australian women.

We have found endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and associated unfolded protein response (UPR), a crucial process involve in cellular protein folding, play a key role in airway remodelling in asthma. This study will investigate whether inhibition of ERS prevents goblet cell metaplasia, mucus hypersecretion and fibrosis and can be used as a therapeutic strategy for severe asthma."

One problem in developing new control strategies for malaria is that following a malaria infection, individuals develop disruptive immune responses that block vaccines. Our project investigates the ability of a repurposed drug to prevent the development of disruptive immune responses during malaria in humans. Results of our studies will inform the development of new malaria control tools."
2002965,Dr Andre Samson,Ideas Grants,Deadly commute - targeting the trafficking mechanisms that licence inflammatory cell death,Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research,15/12/2020,774544.15,"MLKL is a protein naturally found inside cells. MLKL is activated by inflammation. Once activated, MLKL relocates to the outer periphery of cells and kills them. Gut cells are especially vulnerable to death-by-MLKL and this problem causes Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Using cutting edge microscopy, we have discovered how MLKL moves to the periphery of cells prior to killing them. We will test if blocking this movement of MLKL to the cell periphery stops gut death and Inflammatory Bowel Disease."
2002969,Dr Tobias Merson,Ideas Grants,Reversing age-related impairment of myelin repair - a novel therapy for MS,Monash University,15/12/2020,1053161,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the brain and spinal cord caused by the loss of myelin which normally insulates the axons (cables) of nerve cells. When myelin is lost, electrical signals cannot pass along axons normally. Regenerating this myelin is key to restoring normal nerve function but myelin repair deteriorates with age. We will determine whether age-associated decline in myelin repair can be reversed by rejuvenating the myelin repair process."

Fibrotic diseases are devastating to both the individual and our community and we lack effective therapies. We have identified a small protein, named SPRF, which represents a new mechanism in tissue fibrosis. These studies will examine the role of the SRPF protein in models of kidney, heart and lung fibrosis and its underlying mechanism of action. We will also test a therapy based on inhibiting SPRF function."

While a vaccine does exist, efficacy is poor and protection wanes rapidly. We have made breakthroughs in understanding the immune response to malaria that allow us to design a new generation of malaria vaccines. Based on this we aim to generate a vaccine that induces sustained levels of high-quality antibodies targeting multiple targets on the parasite and so can provide sustained long-term protection."

During metastasis the cancer spreads to multiple organs and new combinations of genes become activated, making it difficult to develop new treatments. We will investigate these patterns of activation of genes in metastatic samples and how the immune system interacts with the cancer. We will use computational models to identify new drug targets and evaluate immunotherapy as an option."

2022244,Dr Yvonne Kong,Postgraduate Scholarships,,University of Sydney,17/11/2022,98470.17,"Patients with diabetes face an increased risk of diseases linked to abnormal blood clotting, such as heart attacks and strokes. Our initial studies show platelets from patients with diabetes, which are hyperactive, produce more inflammatory proteins such as CXCL3. This opens new opportunities for drugs to block platelet inflammation to prevent heart attacks, with potentially fewer bleeding side-effects compared to traditional treatments."
2022247,Mr Yunduo Zhao,Postgraduate Scholarships,,University of Sydney,17/11/2022,80864.92,"This biomedical engineering program aims to develop a patient-specific biochip to diagnose and predict blood clot tendency at an earlier stage. The point-of-care prothrombotic prediction device will be suitable for patients with high blood clot risks such as diabetes and, more recently, the COVID-19. It also serves as a testing platform for new anti-platelet and anti-coagulant drugs, and as a way for surgeons to screen patients for anti-thrombotic before operating to avoid uncontrolled bleeding."
2022273,Dr Natasha Gorrie,Postgraduate Scholarships,,University of New South Wales,17/11/2022,136151,"Cardiac amyloid is a multi-system disorder with poor survival that presents as heart failure, rhythm issues or strokes. New treatments improving survival are available but costly. The prevalence of genetic mutations, the best test and how to diagnose early disease is unclear. Cardiac amyloid patients and families will have genetic testing and cardiac imaging to identify the prevalence of mutations, the best and earliest diagnostic tests and better explain heart changes associated with strokes."
2022274,Dr Douglas Tjandra,Postgraduate Scholarships,,Monash University,17/11/2022,136151,"Stomach cancer is a rare type of cancer in Australia which is often diagnosed late and has a poor survival. Intestinal metaplasia is a change in the stomach which precedes cancer in some people. However, the best way to monitor patients with this condition is not known. This project will try to understand why some people develop stomach cancer, and how we should monitor patients with intestinal metaplasia. This will include developing a world-first model in the lab using cells from patients."

At present, we cannot predict which young children who wheeze will progress to develop the lung disease asthma. Thus, we cannot prevent asthma and treatment for asthma is broadly the same for everyone. We will analyse skin cells from inside the nose and blood cells from children who wheeze. Changes in these cells will help predict who will go on to develop asthma. Better, more specific treatments can also be developed."
