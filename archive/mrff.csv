The strategic partners driving this application, The University of Queensland (UQ), The Doherty Institute (Doherty), and The Commonwealth Science Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), aim to complete pre-clinical evaluation of safety and protective efficacy in Q2 and Phase I human trials in Q3 2020. This will run in parallel with a separately proposed plan to expedite manufacturing at-scale. This ambitious approach has the potential to enable an Australian vaccine at an unprecedented pace, and have significant numbers of product in vial by the end of 2020 for further clinical and potential emergency distribution. If public health measures sufficiently slow infection rates, this increased speed has potential to have a major impact, especially for those at most risk, people with pre-existing medical conditions and the elderly. Given our recent progress, including identification of a candidate vaccine molecule, the funds requested in this proposal will be critical for studies designed to measure correlates of immune protection in COVID-19 patients during recovery and any immune responses associated with poor outcomes. Importantly, this work is also not covered by existing CEPI funding and fills a critical gap for vaccine development. Assays for these immune responses will be developed and used in animal vaccination studies and the human Phase I clinical trial.

Unnecessary use of the latest line of anti-tuberculosis WHO class 5 drugs leads to the development of drug resistance, while use of drugs to which the bacterium is resistant leads to prolonged treatment and exposure of family members, leading to greater rates of transmission and increased mortality. Currently, rapid identification of rifampicin resistance has been made possible in-country through Gene-Xpert; however full characterisation of drug resistance is currently done out-of-country and takes months before results are known. It is possible to generate highly accurate predictions of drug resistance for many TB drugs from whole-genome sequencing; however, this is typically achieved by first culturing the bacterial isolate over several weeks. Real-time nanopore metagenomic sequencing is promising, but is prohibitively expensive due to the very small proportion of mycobacterial to human DNA in sputum. We have developed nanoparticles which can enrich mycobacterium directly from biological sample. We propose to use these nanoparticles in conjunction with real-time nanopore sequencing and streaming bioinformatics to characterise drug resistance in Papua New Guinea.",Professor Lachlan Coin,"Professor Lachlan Coin, Doctor Rendi Moke, Doctor Arnold Bainomugisa, Doctor Mark Blaskovich, Doctor Sanjaya KC, Professor Matthew Cooper",Targeted competitive,1/6/2020,31/7/2025,"MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES, Medical microbiology, Medical bacteriology",Clinical Medicine and Science Research,784966.72,Prior to 03/09/2024

Summary: 1. Significant improvement in quality of care in Aboriginal primary health care through developing tools to develop/enhance non-clinical KPIs. 2. Aboriginal Primary Health services will be the focus of consolidating/evaluating the delivery of Trauma Informed Care at all levels within their organisations. 3. A cohort of 800 Indigenous residents has been recruited to Baker’s HTLV-1 community survey. It will partner with those already engaged to a Longitudinal Study, expanding to WA’s Ngaanyatjarra region. 4. Research has often been imposed on Aboriginal people with little meaningful exchange of knowledge/understanding. To assist Aboriginal communities, services and board members in improving understanding/benefits/outcomes of research, to become partners in driving research. 5. Reports of youth crime and risky behaviour in Alice Springs have increased. There is an absence of young people’s voices and input into understanding the issues and identifying solutions for young people most at risk. 6. Effective communications between health staff and patients across the Central Australia Health Service is a critical element in improving health outcomes. It is designed to provide sustained improvement in intercultural communication into policy/practice. 7. Aboriginal people experience of very high levels of psychological distress is unacceptably elevated compared with non-Indigenous. The project involves establishing a prototype SEWB assessment instrument that is culturally relevant and safe. 8. The need for an effective primary health care system is urgent in remote Aboriginal communities in order to “close the health gap”. This aims to measure the impact of short-term health staff in the remote Ngaanyatjarra Health Service; co-design and implement a comprehensive, affordable, culturally safe and evidence-based workforce strategy. 9. The burden of disease and mortality rate increases with increasing remoteness—there is a need for effective primary health care services, but also for effective emergency services which give remote residents access to life-saving care. A dedicated Medical Retrieval and Consultation Centre was launched in 2018. This study will evaluate the timeliness, efficiency and impact of Centre. 10. Disparities between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians with diabetes are most striking in young people.

Our team has conducted multiple primary studies and systematic reviews of interventions that reduce inappropriate primary care prescribing (e.g. audit and feedback, delayed prescribing and shared decision making). General practice (GP) uptake of these interventions is suboptimal, and research is needed to determine better strategies for increasing awareness and their implementation among GPs. We will focus on reducing antibiotic use for acute self-limiting conditions commonly managed in primary care: sore throat, cough, sinusitis and “colds”. Without a national primary care antibiotic stewardship strategy and the increasing danger posed by antibiotic resistance, promoting the judicious use of antibiotics and reducing their prescription in primary care is a viable approach to safely reducing antibiotic resistance. We will conduct a multifaceted national implementation study in Primary Care. Using current evidence on effective strategies to reduce inappropriate prescribing, we will co-design a final package of these with primary care partners. The participants will be stakeholder groups at each practice (practice managers, nurses, and GPs) along with end-user consumers. The interventions will target two stages: (i) a “priming” intervention aimed at improving the motivation of GPs who are not currently interested, and (ii) a “reduction” intervention to help GPs achieve a stepwise reduction in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. For each stage, theory-based implementation interventions will be designed to address the discriminant beliefs and behaviours that lead to the inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics, using existing empirically developed and evaluated resources.

Our consultations and research to date have demonstrated there is disparity between the information provided by genetic services and what Indigenous communities actually seek, resulting in a breakdown of trust, and increased obstacles to accessing and engaging with these services. To address this, culturally appropriate resources that facilitate twoway learning and communication between communities, Indigenous health services, genetic health care providers, as well as policy options that address this space are needed. The effective delivery of genomic medicine hinges on a shared understanding for informed decision making and patient trust in health services. This involves building capacity and capability in three areas: genetic health literacy in communities; culturally safe practices in mainstream services; and policy. Our project aims to address these areas using participatory action research, a two-way learning framework, and policy analysis to develop 1) an educational package tailored for genetic and public health professionals; 2) a suite of genetic health literacy resources for community members and Indigenous health services; and 3) new policy directions. Our collaborative approach involves partnering with First Nations patients, families, communities and organisations, as well as genetic health service clinicians and providers, to co-create these resources and educational interventions as well as informing a policy analysis for transformational change.
